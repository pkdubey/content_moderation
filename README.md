## 📌 Project Overview

A sophisticated content moderation system that uses multiple layers of filtering and AI-based classification to detect and filter inappropriate content. The system combines:

- Rule-based filtering using predefined word lists
- Machine learning-based toxicity detection using DistilBERT
- Configurable confidence thresholds for classification
- Data augmentation for improved model performance with small datasets

## 🛠️ Implementation Highlights

### 1. Multi-Layer Content Moderation

The system uses a hierarchical approach to content moderation:

1. **Empty Content Check**: Filters out empty or whitespace-only messages
2. **Word List Filtering**: Checks against banned and political word lists
3. **AI-Based Classification**: Uses DistilBERT model for toxicity detection
4. **Confidence Thresholds**: Configurable threshold (default: 0.7) for toxicity classification

### 2. Key Components

#### Rule-Based Filtering (`filter.py`)

- Maintains lists of banned and political terms
- Case-insensitive matching
- Returns specific terms that triggered the filter

#### AI Classification (`moderate.py`)

- Uses fine-tuned DistilBERT model
- Binary classification (toxic vs clean)
- Returns probabilities for decision transparency
- GPU acceleration when available

#### Model Training (`train_transformer.py`)

- Data augmentation for small datasets
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, F1, precision, recall
- Checkpointing for best model selection

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- pandas, scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd content_moderation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your training data:

   - Place your labeled data in `data/training_data.csv`
   - Format: two columns named 'text' and 'label' (1=toxic, 0=clean)
   - Minimum 2 examples of each class required

4. Train the model:

   ```bash
   python src/train_transformer.py
   ```

5. Use the moderation system:
   ```bash
   python main.py "Text to moderate"
   ```

### Example Usage

```python
from src.moderate import moderate_content

# Moderate a single piece of text
result = moderate_content("Text to moderate")
print(result)  # Returns: "✅ Approved: Clean content" or "❌ Blocked: ..."
```

## 🔧 Configuration and Customization

### Word Lists

- `data/banned_words.txt`: Add or remove banned terms (one per line)
- `data/political_words.txt`: Manage political terms (one per line)

### Model Configuration

You can adjust the following parameters in the code:

1. Toxicity Threshold (`moderate.py`):

   ```python
   classify_text(text, threshold=0.7)  # Adjust confidence threshold
   ```

2. Training Parameters (`train_transformer.py`):
   ```python
   training_args = TrainingArguments(
       num_train_epochs=10,          # Number of training epochs
       per_device_train_batch_size=4,# Batch size
       learning_rate=5e-5,          # Learning rate
       # ...
   )
   ```

### Data Augmentation

For small datasets (<100 examples), the system automatically applies:

- Random case changes
- Punctuation modification
- Word repetition

## 📊 Model Performance

The system evaluates the model on:

- Accuracy: Binary classification accuracy
- F1 Score: Balance between precision and recall
- Precision: Accuracy of toxic predictions
- Recall: Ability to detect all toxic content

Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting (patience=3 epochs).

## 📦 Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:

```
transformers     # Hugging Face Transformers library for DistilBERT
datasets        # Data loading and processing
scikit-learn    # Metrics calculation and data splitting
torch           # PyTorch for deep learning
tqdm            # Progress bars for training
```

Additional dependencies installed automatically:

- `accelerate`: For optimized training
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `pandas`: For data manipulation

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Loading Errors**

   ```
   Error: Failed to load model
   ```

   - Ensure the model is properly trained and saved in `models/transformer_model/`
   - Check if you have sufficient disk space
   - Verify all model files are present (config.json, model.safetensors, etc.)

2. **CUDA/GPU Issues**

   ```
   CUDA out of memory
   ```

   - Reduce batch size in `train_transformer.py`
   - Try running on CPU if GPU memory is limited

3. **Training Data Issues**

   ```
   ValueError: Need at least 2 examples of each class
   ```

   - Ensure your training data has both toxic and clean examples
   - Check the format of `training_data.csv`

4. **Memory Issues During Training**
   - Reduce `max_length` in tokenizer (default: 128)
   - Decrease batch size
   - Use gradient accumulation steps

## 📈 Checkpoints and Model Versions

The system maintains multiple checkpoints during training:

```
models/transformer_model/
├── checkpoint-3/     # Early training checkpoint
└── checkpoint-6/     # Later training checkpoint
```

Each checkpoint contains:

- Model weights (model.safetensors)
- Optimizer state (optimizer.pt)
- Training configuration (training_args.bin)
- Scheduler state (scheduler.pt)
